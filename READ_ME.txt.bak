Description of folders: 
 
- **datasets/** 

Folder containing atasets needed to run the analyses.

- **trees/** 

Folder to store trees phylogenetic trees used in the analyses.

Scripts:

> 00_utility functions.R

Custom functions used in the analyses.

> 01_taxize_names.R

Creates reference table to match taxonomic backbones across all datasets (WCVP, GBIF, phylogenies)

> 02_standardizing_taxonomy.R

Standardizes the taxonomy of the preliminary list of neotropical climbing angiosperms based on Kew's WCVP.

> 03_objects_for_analyses.R

Creates objects (data frames, trees, etc) for the diversification and spatial analyses.

> 04_retrieve_gbif_points.R

Retrieves occurrence ponits from GBIF for every species of neotropical climbing plant.

> 05_cleaning_gbif_points.R

Cleans GBIF points of spurious coordinates and uses Kew's TDWG shapefiles to crops species' points to their natural occurrences.

> 06_map_climbers_proportion.R

Creates maps of climbing species proportions as seen in Figure 2 of the main manuscript.

> 07_spatial_analyses.R

Tests hypothesis #2.

> 08_div_rates_ci_plots.R

Tests hypothesis #1 and creates plots of confidence intervals of diversification rates using climbing plant generas' crown and stem ages.

> 09_different_cutoffs.R

Script for diversification analyses considering different percentage cutoffs of climbing species in genera.

> 10_family_background.R

Constrasts climbing genera of a few selectde families against the diversification rates of such families as background.

> 11_div_rates_phyloanova.R

Calculates the phylANOVA.

> 12_make_backbone_tree.R

Creates the backbone tree used in the phylANOVA of both hypotheses.
